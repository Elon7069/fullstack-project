## Step 1: Check package.json Files
Frontend:

Open the package.json file in your frontend folder.

Look for the "dependencies" and "devDependencies" sections.

Backend:

Open the package.json file in your backend folder.

Look for the "dependencies" and "devDependencies" sections.

Step 2: List of Libraries and Dependencies
Hereâ€™s a general template for listing dependencies. Replace the placeholders with the actual libraries from your package.json files.

Frontend Dependencies
json
Copy
```
"dependencies": {
  "react": "^18.2.0",
  "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
  "react-router-dom": "^6.3.0",
  "axios": "^1.3.4",
  "redux": "^4.2.0",
  "react-redux": "^8.0.5",
  "sass": "^1.58.3",
  "bootstrap": "^5.2.3"
}
```
,
"devDependencies": {
  "vite": "^4.1.0",
  "eslint": "^8.34.0",
  "prettier": "^2.8.4"
}
Backend Dependencies
json
Copy
"dependencies": {
  "express": "^4.18.2",
  "cors": "^2.8.5",
  "mongoose": "^7.0.3",
  "dotenv": "^16.0.3",
  "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.0",
  "bcryptjs": "^2.4.3"
},
"devDependencies": {
  "nodemon": "^2.0.20",
  "eslint": "^8.34.0"
}
Step 3: Generate the List
